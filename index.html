<p>GitHub has evolved into an all-in-one "developer command center" that handles much more than simple code storage. It is used for version control, automated software delivery, project management, and AI-driven development. </p>
<h2>1. Core Code & Version Management</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Uses Git to track every change to a project, allowing you to "time travel" back to previous versions if something breaks.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration (Pull Requests):</strong> Teams use Pull Requests to propose changes, discuss code line-by-line, and run automated quality checks before merging work into the main project.</li>
	<li><strong>Branching:</strong> Creates isolated "sandboxes" to experiment with new features or fix bugs without affecting the live version of the software.</li>
	<li><strong>Gists:</strong> Used for sharing small snippets of code or text quickly without creating a full repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Automation & Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Automates repetitive tasks like running tests, building software, and deploying code to servers whenever changes are pushed.</li>
	<li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Hosts static websites (portfolios, documentation, or project demos) for free directly from a repository.</li>
	<li><strong>GitHub Packages:</strong> Acts as a hosting service for software "artifacts" like Docker images, NPM packages, and Maven jars.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Project & Team Management</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>GitHub Issues:</strong> Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks with labels, assignees, and milestones.</li>
	<li><strong>GitHub Projects:</strong> Provides Kanban-style boards and roadmaps (similar to Trello or Jira) to visualize and manage workflows across a team.</li>
	<li><strong>Discussions:</strong> Offers a forum-like space for community Q&A and brainstorming, keeping technical bug trackers clean.</li>
	<li><strong>Wikis:</strong> Hosts long-form project documentation and manuals directly alongside the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. AI & Cloud Development</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>GitHub Copilot:</strong> An AI-powered assistant that suggests code in real-time, helps write tests, and can even manage entire iterative coding cycles.</li>
	<li><strong>GitHub Codespaces:</strong> Instantly spins up a full development environment in the cloud, allowing you to code in your browser without setting up anything on your local machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Security & Governance</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Secret Scanning:</strong> Automatically detects accidentally committed API keys or passwords to prevent security breaches.</li>
	<li><strong>Dependabot:</strong> Monitors your project's third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities and automatically opens PRs to update them.</li>
	<li><strong>CodeQL:</strong> Performs deep static analysis to find security flaws in your code automatically.</li>
</ul>
 

<h2>6. Portfolio & Networking</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Showcasing Work:</strong> Developers use GitHub as a professional portfolio to show potential employers their coding style and contribution history.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Source Contribution:</strong> It serves as the primary hub for contributing to global projects like React, Linux, or VS Code.</li>
</ul>
